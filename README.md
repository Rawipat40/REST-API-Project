# Go Project

## Description
This project is a learning exercise focused on building a RESTful API using the Go programming language. It utilizes the Go Gin Web Framework for handling HTTP requests, go-sqlite for database operations, and jwt-go for JSON Web Token (JWT) generation and verification. The project implements various functionalities including user management (signup, login, credential validation), event registration, and CRUD operations for events.

## Technologies/Frameworks Used
- Go (Golang)
- Go Gin Web Framework
- go-sqlite
- jwt-go

## Features Implemented
- Creation of events table
- Creation of registrations table
- Creation of user table
- JWT token generation
- JWT token verification
- User functions: signup, login, credential validation
- RESTful API for events: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
- Usage of middlewares for authentication
- API testing
